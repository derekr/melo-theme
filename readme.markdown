## Installation

### Espresso

Simply place the `melo.foam` file in your `~/Library/Application\ Support/Espresso/Themes` directory. Restart Espresso and bwam! You've got yourself one gorgeous theme installed!

## Notes

Currently only Espresso is support, but I plan on porting to Textmate as soon as I get some free time. If you can't wait, feel free to port it yourself!
